# esp32-homekit-camera

Firmware for esp32-camera module to act as Apple Homekit IP camera.

Based on [esp-homekit](https://github.com/maximkulkin/esp-homekit).

## Prerequisites

* esp-idf
    * Install esp-idf by following instructions on esp-idf project page (https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf#setting-up-esp-idf). 
    * At the end you should have xtensa-esp32-elf toolchain in your path and IDF_PATH environment variable pointing to esp-idf directory.

## Build instructions ESP32

1. Clone git repo
1. Change directory to repo `cd esp32-homekit-camera`
1. Initialize and sync all submodules (recursively) `git submodule update --init --recursive`
1. Configure device settings per **menuconfig settings** section, `make menuconfig`
    * This step is critical
1. Apply **esp32-camera.patch** patch `git apply --directory="components/esp32-camera" esp32-camera.patch`
1. Compile code `make all`
1. To prevent any effects from previous firmware (e.g. firmware crashing right at start), highly recommend to erase flash `make erase_flash`
1. Upload Upload firmware to ESP32 `make flash monitor`
    * Note, ESP32 **GPIO0** pin needs to be connected to **GND** pin to enable flashing
    * To exit monitor, on mac *control+]*

## Menuconfig settings

Before compiling, you need to alter several settings in **menuconfig**, follow configuration prompts `make menuconfig`:
* Serial flasher config
    * Default serial port
    * Flash size = **4 MB**
* Partition Table
    * Partition Table = **Custom partition table CSV**
    * Custom partition CSV file = **partitions.csv**
* Component config
    * Driver configuration
        * RTCIO configuration
            * Support array `rtc_gpio_desc` for ESP32 = **check**
    * ESP32-specific
        * Support for external, SPI-connected RAM = **check**
        * SPI RAM config
            * Initialize SPI RAM during startup = **check**
            * SPI RAM access method = **Make RAM allocatable using malloc() as well**
    * Camera configuration
        * OV2640 Support = **check**
    * HomeKit
        * SPI flash address for storing HomeKit data = **0x3A0000**
* ESP32 HomeKit Camera
    * WiFi SSID
    * WiFi Password
    * Device hostname
    * Select Camera Pinout
        * Select Camera Pinout = *your variant of module*
    * LED Pin
        * PIN = *your variant of module*
            * ESP32-CAM by AI-Thinker == **33**
    * Image sensor vertical flip
        * Toggle if HomeKit app has video feed upside down
    * Image sensor horizontal mirror
        * Toggle if HomeKit app has video feed mirrored
    * Image sensor enhance settings
        * EXPERIMENTAL: adjusts contrast, saturation, etc for *better* image quality
    * HomeKit Device Setup Code
    * HomeKit Device Manufacturer
    * HomeKit Device model name
    * HomeKit Device model number
    * HomeKit Device Serial number
    * Use WIFI MAC address as serial number
        * Note: this takes precedence over static serial number setting above
    * HomeKit Device Firmware version
